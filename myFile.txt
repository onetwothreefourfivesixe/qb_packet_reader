According
to
legend,
the
first
man
to
hold
this
office
was
personally
responsible
for
prohibiting
the
adoption
of
German
as
a
national
language.
One
holder
of
this
office
stepped
down
from
it
in
the
wake
of
dealings
with
Tongsun
Park
in
Koreagate;
that
man
was
Carl
Albert.
First
held
by
Frederick
Muhlenberg,
the
longest
tenured
holder
of
this
office
often
went
by
the
nickname
"Mr.
Democrat."
Charles
Crisp
tried
to
use
the
(*)
disappearing
quorum
tactic
against
one
holder
of
this
office,
which
was
held
by
Sam
Rayburn
during
the
New
Deal
era.
Once
held
by
"Czar"
Reed,
this
position's
holder
is
second
in
line
to
the
presidential
succession.
For
10
points,
name
this
position
held
by
people
like
Nancy
Pelosi
and
John
Boehner
["BAY-ner"].
