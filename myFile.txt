This
lake
features
a
rock
called
Carleton's
Prize,
which
was
once
bombarded
for
an
hour
after
British
forces
mistook
the
rock
for
an
enemy
ship.
This
lake's
northern
shore
was
the
site
of
Fort
Blunder,
so-named
because
it
was
accidentally
built
in
the
wrong
country.
This
lake's
Fort
Crown
Point
was
abandoned
by
(*)
Benedict
Arnold
after
his
fleet
lost
the
Battle
of
Valcour
Island.
It
lies
east
of
the
Adirondacks
and
west
of
the
Green
Mountains,
which
were
the
base
of
Ethan
Allen's
Green
Mountain
Boys.
Fort
Ticonderoga
defended
this
lake,
which
served
as
a
northeastern
gateway
to
the
Hudson
River
Valley.
For
10
points,
name
this
lake
that
forms
the
border
between
Vermont
and
upper
New
York.
